The LG Hombot `vacuum` platform allows you to control the state of your LG Hombot robot vacuum.
This robot is also called Roboking in some countries.

You first have to plug a wifi dongle to your robot and [install Wifi support](https://www.roboter-forum.com/index.php?thread/10009-lg-hombot-3-0-wlan-kamera-steuerung-per-weboberfl%C3%A4che/&postID=107354#post107354) before it can be controlled by this platform.
